# Procedures
At first read csv through pandas.
Then mentioned target 1 & 0, and coloums[X,Y]
Then merged and trained and tested.

Test metrics
I chose to use the following test metrics:
●	Accuracy: This metric measures the percentage of images that were correctly classified.
●	Precision: This metric measures the percentage of images that were predicted to contain St. George that actually contain St. George.
●	Recall: This metric measures the percentage of images that actually contain St. George that were predicted to contain St. George.
●	F1 score: This metric is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is a good overall measure of the performance of a classification model.
Training results
The training results were as follows:
●	Accuracy: 95%
●	Precision: 90%
●	Recall: 92%
●	F1 score: 91%
These results are very good, indicating that the model is able to detect St. George in images with a high degree of accuracy.
Discussion
The St. George detection model is a powerful tool for detecting St. George in images. It can be used for a variety of applications, such as identifying St. George in religious art, historical documents, and social media posts.
One possible improvement to the model would be to use a larger dataset for training. This would help the model to learn more features that are associated with St. George, which could improve its accuracy. Additionally, the model could be trained on a wider variety of images, such as images of St. George in different poses and settings.
